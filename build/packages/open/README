---- bff  IBM AIX
rpm support was dropped (according to Brian) because of problems in some versions.

---- pkg  Solaris.

Solaris will not allow installing two packages of the same name and version. If they are the same name, a later version may overwrite an existing version.

The package manager has no support for package upgrades and the manuals suggest very buggy/hackish ideas for handling upgrades.
